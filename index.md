# DOT-PIM Workshop



## Overview

In the era of artificial intelligence and big data, the von Neumann architecture with separated memory and computing is facing a serious "memory wall" problem. The data movements have become the main bottleneck limiting the performance and energy efficiency of hardware platforms. The emerging Processing-In-Memory (PIM) architectures provide an effective solution to overcome the memory wall problem. PIM architectures perform the in-situ matrix-vector multiplications in memory or general-purpose computing near memory, eliminating data movements between memory and computing units. Due to their high energy efficiency, PIM architectures are beneficial for embedded systems and gain increasing attention from academia and industry.

However, the new computing paradigm and emerging memory technologies bring serious design challenges for PIM. 
-	Firstly, the analog-domain computing of PIM is sensitive to circuit noises and device non-ideal factors. Efficient and precise circuit/device models are required.
- Secondly, the large-scale PIM architectures require an unacceptably long time of circuit simulation (e.g., SPICE), making the PIM architecture and chip design inefficient.
- Thirdly, the co-design space of intelligent algorithms and PIM architectures is extremely large. How to enable efficient software-hardware co-exploration becomes a research hotspot.

In view of the above challenges, this workshop will invite the leading experts from the PIM community to share their wonderful achievements in design and optimization tools for PIM. We hope DOT-PIM can help researchers to better understand the design challenges of PIM and inspire further research directions. It will also summarize and result in a survey paper about PIM design tools (submitted to related ACM/IEEE journals, e.g., ACM TODAES, IEEE TCAD, etc.). As a complement to ESWEEK, we believe DOT-PIM will enable a strong synergy between PIM architectures and embedded systems and propose potential ideas to achieve important progress in the future.

## Call for Poster

In recent years, the emerging Processing-In-Memory (PIM) architectures have provided an effective solution to overcome the memory wall problem of von Neumann architectures. PIM architectures perform the in-situ matrix-vector multiplications in memory or general-purpose computing near memory and are beneficial for embedded systems and gain increasing attention from academia and industry. The Workshop on Agile Design and Optimization Tools for Processing-In-Memory (DOT-PIM) will invite the leading experts from the PIM community to share their wonderful achievements in design and optimization tools for PIM. We hope DOT-PIM can help researchers to better understand the design challenges of PIM and inspire further research directions.

DOT-PIM also aims to attract research work with original contributions that address design challenges in PIM architectures & circuits and promote the performance of PIM architectures. The workshop is co-located with ESWEEK 2023 to attract the large ESWEEK audience. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
* Simulation and modeling tools for PIM architectures
* Instruction Set Architectures (ISA) and compilers for non-von Neumann computing paradigms
* High-level synthesis and logic synthesis tools for PIM architectures & circuits
* Physical design automation tools for PIM circuits
* Novel PIM architectures for new applications
* Domain-specific PIM architectures and algorithms co-optimization
* Security and reliability enhancement for emerging PIM systems

DOT-PIM will summarize and result in a survey paper about PIM design tools (submitted to related ACM/IEEE journals, e.g., ACM TODAES, IEEE TCAD, etc.). All posters presented in the workshop can be reported and featured in the survey paper. Presenters of the poster will also be invited as co-authors of the survey paper.

We invite your poster submissions for DOT-PIM. A two-page PDF abstract of the research work should be submitted to Prof. Yu Wang (yu-wang@tsinghua.edu.cn) via email. Abstracts should be in PDF form in two-column format, up to 2 pages in length with 1-inch margins and 10–11-point font size. Abstracts should list the full names and affiliations of all authors and the contact information of the corresponding author. Abstracts will be reviewed by the Program Committee. Those that are selected for poster presentations will be distributed to workshop participants.
